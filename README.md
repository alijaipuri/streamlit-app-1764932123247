# 🎯 AI-Generated Streamlit App

> This application was automatically generated using AI technology.

## 📝 Description

The stock market produces large amounts of daily price data that can be difficult for users to understand and analyze. Many people want a simple tool where they can check a stock’s past performance and also get an idea of its possible future trend.
The goal of this project is to build a Streamlit application that allows users to:
View historical stock prices for any company.
Visualize trends using charts.
Forecast future stock prices using basic time-series models.
This application will help users easily explore stock data, understand patterns, and see simple predictions in one place.
